  <summary>Class to automatically build HTML_QuickForm objects from a DB_DataObject-derived class</summary>
  <description>
  DB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application development using the packages
  DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For having a quick but working prototype of your application,
  simply model the database, run DataObject´s createTable script over it and write a script
  that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class.
  The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can
  use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect
  if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted.
  If you have set up DataObject´s links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect
  if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table´s entries.
  There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties
  of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning
  the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.

      <notes>
This version introduces some BC breaks, most of which can be corrected by using a provided
fix script. If you have already used FormBuilder in your current projects, please read all
of this very carefully!

<b>MAJOR BC BREAKS</b> -- Please read all comments below before trying to use this version!
This checkin is the result of an attempt at unifying the various parts of the FormBuilder API, unifying the coding styles, and conforming to PEAR CS. This *will* break your application.

All options are now configurable through the DataObject. Any option that could be in the FormBuilder can now be in the DataObject.

All options in the DataObject now have a "fb_" prefix to distinguish them from field names.

All options in both the FormBuilder and DataObject were changed to use studlyCaps instead_of_underscores.

Some few options have changed names. For example, follow_links is now linkDisplayLevel.

All options may be specified in the [DB_DataObject_FormBuilder] section of the ini file. For options that are DataObject specific, these are set as defaults. The DataObject may change them through its options. selectDisplayFields and selectOrderFields are arrays and set the same as elementTypeMap.

All options in the [DB_DataObject_FormBuilder] section of the ini file are copied into the FormBuilder when it is instantiated. Hence, changing $GLOBALS['_DB_DATAOVJECT_FORMBUILDER']['CONFIG'] after you create your FormBuilder will no longer work.

All options in the DataObject (except for those that start with "select") are copied to the FormBuilder after preGenerateForm is called. This is to cut down on the internal complexity of FormBuilder. This means that you cannot change options in the DataObject after preGenerateForm (such as in postGenerateForm). We don't see this as a problem as you cn set everything up before then and (nearly) all options are used once postGenerateForm is called. If you know of a problem with this, please send us an e-mail or a bug report. This also means that you cannot re-use a FormBuilder object as the settings of the previous FormBuilder will persist.

The database.formBuilder.ini file is no longer used. Select display and order fields should be put in the DO file as selectDisplayFields and selectOrderFields.

The script in CVS called fix0.9.0Files.php should be able to fix all BC breaks in your code and ini files. If it doesn't please send an e-mail to justinpatrin@php.net so that I can fix it.


What follows is a list if changes I kept track of while making this version:
"=>" means "changed to"

Updated some docs (not all) with new stuff below. Made docs at start prettier and easier to read when looking in the code.

All values in $_DB_DATAOBJECT_FORMBUILDER['CONFIG'] are now automatically pulled into member vars in the class in the constructor.

COMPLETELY REMOVED formBuilder.ini. select_display_fields and sleect_order_fields should now be put into the DO as selectDisplayFields and selectOrderFields.

DO options are now copied into the FB *except for* select*Fields and selectAddEmpty. Those are used from the DO if they exist, then the FB. ALL FB members vars will be copied from their DO equivelents, except for FB members that start with _ or are select*Fields or selectAddEmpty.

<b>FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS:</b>
- selectAddEmpty is now an array which should be filled with link fields that should 
  have an empty option in their select box i.e., the option has moved from the linked to the linker
- Removed QuickForm-specific functions from main class and introduced
  new QuickForm-driver class. A third parameter was added to the factory
  method to determine which driver is to be used.
- Fixed bug 1829 - date callbacks not called correctly
- Fixed issues with unset member vars and $options array in constructor
- Better array handling for ini-arrays
- Added more ini options to array handling
- Array based options may be single values without a comma
- Array based options which have no need for keys (selectDisplayFields, etc.) don't need the key
- Fixed bug where linked fields in selectDisplayFields didn't know their own selectDisplayFields
- Fixed bug where cross/tripleLinks are frozen if not in userEditableFields array
- Added missing createSubmit option
- Fixed Bug #1715 (minutes and seconds are lost in _array2date)
- Got rid of Required QF rule for NOT NULL fields which are frozen
- Fixed bug 1699 (Notice: Undefined property _triple/_crossLinks)
- Fixed bug 1700 (Notice: Array to string conversion)
- Added freezing of triplelink elements accoring to elements_to_freeze
- Added missing code to freeze fields not in userEditableFields (if it exists)
- Added code to allow any field to be a link field
- Fixed bug #1500, adding fallback to displaying the primary key in selectboxes 
  if a select_display_field cannot be identified (patch by Justin Patrin)
- Fixed bug #1459 (Thanks to Justin Patrin)
- New feature: Add required rule for NOT NULL fields (Bug #1487, thanks to Justin Patrin)
- New feature: Add field name to error messages.
- Small change to getDataObjectSelectDisplayValue() making use of getLink() instead of links().

      <notes>
        Lots of lots of fixes/changes:
        - New configuration option "elementTypeMap": Allows you to define
          a list of FormBuilder field types and HTML_QuickForm element types
          that should be used for those field types. This way, you can for
          example use a WYSYWIG HTML editing component instead of textareas.
        - New configuration options: "dateToDatabaseCallback" and
          "dateFromDatabaseCallback" allow you to define callback functions
          for date format conversion. This way, you can use any input and
          storage format for dates that you desire.
        - Fixed bug #624: Incompatibility with schema files generated by
          DB_DataObject 1.4.0 and up. Side-effect: FormBuilder now also
          recognizes DATE, DATETIME and TEXT fields automatically, so there
          is no more need to use class properties to define them manually.
        - Conversion of ISO dates to QuickForm date arrays no longer
          relies on strtotime(), but uses PEAR::Date instead to get rid of the
          date range limitations of Unix timestamps
        - You can now also use DATETIME fields, as more formatting
          options for date fields are supported (m,M,d,Y,H,i,s)
        - New experimental option "dateFieldLanguage" allows setting the
          language for date fields, this doesn't seem to work yet though
        - useForm() now knows a second parameter that allows to add elements
          from an existing form to the generated one ... this, too, is to be considered
          highly experimental as the current implementation relies on supposedly private
          QuickForm properties to be public
        - Support for a new callback method in your DataObjects: "dateOptions()"
          allows to return an option array for all or individual date elements. See docs
          for QuickForm's date element for details on possible options
        - Added support for recursive link lookups (by Justin Patrin)
        - Implemented changes by Norbert Moscnik:
          a) added "fieldsToRender" configuration option
          b) added "userEditableFields" configuration option
          c) added "forced_values" configuration option
          d) additional empty option (value="") as the first element of the &lt;select&gt; lists
        - Fixed file upload handling: http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=423
        - Added usage of setter methods: http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=422
        - When processing the form, the new getUserEditableFields() method is used
          to check against manipulated POST requests
        - Added support for definition of display_fields and custom field ordering in
          a separate .ini file (contributed by Justin Patrin)
        - Fixed: Threw notices when no primary key was detected in processForm().
          Will now exit and return false.
        - Added: New method forceQueryType() will let you override the autodetection
          for the query command (insert/update) using new predefined constants.
        - Fixed inconsistency with documentation regarding hide_primary_key (spotted by Norbert Mocsnik)
        - Fixed bug with checks for postProcess() and preProcess() user-methods, spotted by Ron McClain
        - Fixed bug that occured when building selectboxes (if select_order_field was not defined,
          and the linked class had its own select_display_field property, FormBuilder was trying
          to order by a nonexisting field)
        - Fixed small issue in processForm method (detection if submitted values really belong 
          to the current DataObject)
        - Minor change in configuration method (check inline docs!!)
        - New options "createSubmit" and "submitText" to set creation of
          a submit button on/off and specify its text
        - fix bug preventing the options array from being used (Arnaud Limbourg)
        - use raiseError instead of new PEAR_Error, use a variable to make php5 happy (Arnaud Limbourg)
        - Automatically making the primary key a hidden field is now optional
        - Fixed notices when working with E_ALL
        - Fixed bug with element reordering (Arnaud Limbourg)
        - Additions and corrections in inline docs
        - Changed bullshit implementation: Existing form objects are no longer passed
          through the options array, but by using a new method useForm().
