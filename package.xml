  <summary>Class to automatically build HTML_QuickForm objects from a DB_DataObject-derived class</summary>
  <description>
  DB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application development using the packages DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject's createTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up DataObject's links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table's entries. There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.

      <notes>
        -It is now possible to use something other than the primary key for a link. This field must be unique, though, or you will have an inconsistent database. FormBuilder will *not* warn you if the field is not unique.
        -tripleLinks and crossLinks will now always use the field values from the links.ini instead of primary keys
        -Added a 'multiselect' option to the elementTypeMap. You may now set a different QF element type for multiselects.
        -Fixed a bug where tripleLinks and crossLinks were filled out in a new record (non-fetched DO)

        -Fix fatal errors when crossLinkExtraFields is set and the crossLink is of type 'select'
        -Removed all direct use of Primary Key from crossLink and tripleLink code as it was technically incorrect. It now uses the value from the links.ini
        -Fixed issue with populateOptions being called in DataObject callbacks other than preGenerateForm
        -Fixed issue with crossLink tables with no primary key
        -Fixed possible issue with tripleLinks regarding primary key

        -Only set defaults for fields we are processing (bug #3199)
        -fieldsToRender should always be shown, even if not in preDefOrder (bug #3182)
        -Added prepareLinkedDataObject support for crosslinks and triplelinks

        --- The same applies to times *except* that seconds will only be output of they are specified
        ---- If only an hour and minute are specified (or only one of the 2) you will get H:i with no s
        ---- If only seconds are specified you would get 0 for hour and minute

      <version>0.11.1</version>
      <state>beta</state>
      <date>2005-01-08</date>
      <notes>
        0.11.1 adds a file missing in the 0.11.0 release
  
        Lots of new options, bug fixes, and a few changes. Check the wiki for more detailed info on new options.
  
        fixes:
        - Re-added support for timeElementFormat option
        - Re-added "copy" support for dbDateFormat (although it is not currently used)
        - Auto-generated form name is now always lowercase to ensure identical behaviour in PHP4 and PHP5
        - Fixed hidePrimaryKey issues when set in the ini file
        - Moved the rest of the driver-specific to the QuickForm driver
        - Changed crossLink and tripleLink code to use setDefaults (bug #2913)
        - Fix tripleLinks not holding their value after a submit (related to bug #2913)
        - Added support for all date format types specified in bug# 2375
           NOTE: 'l' and 'D' types are supported by _date2Array, but not _array2Date. This means they can be output, but upon submission they do nothing.
        - Fixed freezing problems with crossLinks and tripleLinks (bug #2915)
           A new QuickForm element type has been created for this. It is in DB/DataObject/FormBuilder/QuickForm/ElementTable.php. This element creates an HTML_Table with rows of elements. The table may or may not have row and column headers. Any QF element may be in each cell.
        - Fixed bug where time elements were created with 'date' type options (this should change nothing unless you use elementTypeMap)
        - 0 as primary key no longer causes unwanted insert (bug #2979)
        - Fixed elementNamePrefix and elementNamePostfix when used with crosslink and triplelink and dates
          [ and ] are no longer allowed in the prefix and postfix
  
        changes:
        - The Primary Key is now retrieved using a new internal method (_getPrimaryKey) which looks first in the _primary_key property of the DataObject, then tries sequenceKey(), then the first element in keys()
        - Added patch to "sync" crosslinks and triplelinks instead of deleting all and recreating (Bug #2841)
        - The numeric rule will only be set if FB creates the element (bug #3042)
        - Renamed getDataObjectSelectDisplayValue() to getDataObjectString()
  
        new:
        - Added multi-select support to QF driver
        - Re-added multi-select support for crossLinks
        - Added casting of '' to NULL for link fields (for selectAddEmpty)
        - Added automatic entry of an empty option for link fields which are not DB_DATAOBJECT_NOTNULL
        - Added selectAddEmpty support for enum fields
        - Enum fields will automatically have an empty option if they are allowed to be NULL (same as for links)
        - Added a new crossLinkExtraFields option for crossLinks which allows editing of extra fields in the crosslink table
        - Added prepareLinkedDataObject callback for DO to customize link options (bug #2958)
        - Added elementTypeAttributes and fieldAttributes configuration options to QF driver
        - Added a new option: useCallTimePassByReference which defaults to false (bug #2658)
        - Added support for reverseLinks (request #2889)
        - Added support for boolean fields. Boolean fields are rendered as checkboxes
        - Added new option booleanFields
        - getDataObjectString() is now statically callable

      <notes>
This version introduces major BC breaks, mostly dealing with the names and locations of configuration variables most of which can be corrected by using a provided fix script(s). If you have already used FormBuilder in your current projects, please read all of this very carefully!

MAJOR BC BREAKS -- Please read all comments below before trying to use this version!
This checkin is the result of an attempt at unifying the various parts of the FormBuilder API, unifying the coding styles, and conforming to PEAR CS. This *will* break your application.

All options are now configurable through the DataObject. Any option that could be in the FormBuilder can now be in the DataObject.

All options in the DataObject now have a "fb_" prefix to distinguish them from field names.

All options in both the FormBuilder and DataObject were changed to use studlyCaps instead_of_underscores.

Some few options have changed names. For example, follow_links is now linkDisplayLevel.

All options may be specified in the [DB_DataObject_FormBuilder] section of the ini file. For options that are DataObject specific, these are set as defaults. The DataObject may change them through its options. linkDisplayFields and linkOrderFields (see below) are arrays and set the same as elementTypeMap.

All options in the [DB_DataObject_FormBuilder] section of the ini file are copied into the FormBuilder when it is instantiated. Hence, changing $GLOBALS['_DB_DATAOVJECT_FORMBUILDER']['CONFIG'] after you create your FormBuilder will no longer work.

All options in the DataObject (except for those that start with "select") are copied to the FormBuilder after preGenerateForm is called. This is to cut down on the internal complexity of FormBuilder. This means that you cannot change options in the DataObject after preGenerateForm (such as in postGenerateForm). We don't see this as a problem as you can set everything up before then and (nearly) all options are used once postGenerateForm is called. If you know of a problem with this, please send us an e-mail or a bug report. This also means that you cannot re-use a FormBuilder object as the settings of the previous FormBuilder will persist.

The database.formBuilder.ini file is no longer used. Select display and order fields should be put in the DO file as linkDisplayFields and linkOrderFields. The fix0.9.0Files.php script will move these options into your DataObject classes automatically.

If you were previously using the 0.9.0 release, the script in CVS called fix0.9.0Files.php should be able to fix all BC breaks in your code and ini files. If it doesn't please send an e-mail to justinpatrin@php.net so that I can fix it. You can download the script from this URL: http://cvs.php.net/pear/DB_DataObject_FormBuilder/fix0.9.0Files.php

If you were previously using a CVS version of FormBuilder.php after 1.36 up to 1.52, the script in CVS called fixPre1.52CVSFiles.php should be able to fix any BC problems you have. All this script does is rename sleect*Fields to link*Fields. You can download the script from this URL: http://cvs.php.net/pear/DB_DataObject_FormBuilder/fixPre1.52CVSFiles.php

For a list of all changes, please see the CVS changelogs for FormBuilder.php. Of particular interest should be the changelog for CVS version 1.37.

- Added TIME element handling (Thanks to Frank Fahs)
- Added support for ENUM select or radio generation
3 new options: enumFields, enumOptions, and enumOptionsCallback

- Fixed bug where cross/tripleLinks are frozen if not in userEditableFields array
- Added missing createSubmit option
- Fixed Bug #1715 (minutes and seconds are lost in _array2date)
- Got rid of Required QF rule for NOT NULL fields which are frozen
- Fixed bug 1699 (Notice: Undefined property _triple/_crossLinks)
- Fixed bug 1700 (Notice: Array to string conversion)
- Added freezing of triplelink elements accoring to elements_to_freeze
- Added missing code to freeze fields not in userEditableFields (if it exists)
- Added code to allow any field to be a link field
- Fixed bug #1500, adding fallback to displaying the primary key in selectboxes if a select_display_field cannot be identified (patch by Justin Patrin)
- Fixed bug #1459 (Thanks to Justin Patrin)
- New feature: Add required rule for NOT NULL fields (Bug #1487, thanks to Justin Patrin)
- New feature: Add field name to error messages.
- Small change to getDataObjectSelectDisplayValue() making use of getLink() instead of links().

      <notes>
        Lots of lots of fixes/changes:
        - New configuration option "elementTypeMap": Allows you to define
          a list of FormBuilder field types and HTML_QuickForm element types
          that should be used for those field types. This way, you can for
          example use a WYSYWIG HTML editing component instead of textareas.
        - New configuration options: "dateToDatabaseCallback" and
          "dateFromDatabaseCallback" allow you to define callback functions
          for date format conversion. This way, you can use any input and
          storage format for dates that you desire.
        - Fixed bug #624: Incompatibility with schema files generated by
          DB_DataObject 1.4.0 and up. Side-effect: FormBuilder now also
          recognizes DATE, DATETIME and TEXT fields automatically, so there
          is no more need to use class properties to define them manually.
        - Conversion of ISO dates to QuickForm date arrays no longer
          relies on strtotime(), but uses PEAR::Date instead to get rid of the
          date range limitations of Unix timestamps
        - You can now also use DATETIME fields, as more formatting
          options for date fields are supported (m,M,d,Y,H,i,s)
        - New experimental option "dateFieldLanguage" allows setting the
          language for date fields, this doesn't seem to work yet though
        - useForm() now knows a second parameter that allows to add elements
          from an existing form to the generated one ... this, too, is to be considered
          highly experimental as the current implementation relies on supposedly private
          QuickForm properties to be public
        - Support for a new callback method in your DataObjects: "dateOptions()"
          allows to return an option array for all or individual date elements. See docs
          for QuickForm's date element for details on possible options
        - Added support for recursive link lookups (by Justin Patrin)
        - Implemented changes by Norbert Moscnik:
          a) added "fieldsToRender" configuration option
          b) added "userEditableFields" configuration option
          c) added "forced_values" configuration option
          d) additional empty option (value="") as the first element of the &lt;select&gt; lists
        - Fixed file upload handling: http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=423
        - Added usage of setter methods: http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=422
        - When processing the form, the new getUserEditableFields() method is used
          to check against manipulated POST requests
        - Added support for definition of display_fields and custom field ordering in
          a separate .ini file (contributed by Justin Patrin)
        - Fixed: Threw notices when no primary key was detected in processForm().
          Will now exit and return false.
        - Added: New method forceQueryType() will let you override the autodetection
          for the query command (insert/update) using new predefined constants.
        - Fixed inconsistency with documentation regarding hide_primary_key (spotted by Norbert Mocsnik)
        - Fixed bug with checks for postProcess() and preProcess() user-methods, spotted by Ron McClain
        - Fixed bug that occured when building selectboxes (if select_order_field was not defined,
          and the linked class had its own select_display_field property, FormBuilder was trying
          to order by a nonexisting field)
        - Fixed small issue in processForm method (detection if submitted values really belong 
          to the current DataObject)
        - Minor change in configuration method (check inline docs!!)
        - New options "createSubmit" and "submitText" to set creation of
          a submit button on/off and specify its text
        - fix bug preventing the options array from being used (Arnaud Limbourg)
        - use raiseError instead of new PEAR_Error, use a variable to make php5 happy (Arnaud Limbourg)
        - Automatically making the primary key a hidden field is now optional
        - Fixed notices when working with E_ALL
        - Fixed bug with element reordering (Arnaud Limbourg)
        - Additions and corrections in inline docs
        - Changed bullshit implementation: Existing form objects are no longer passed
          through the options array, but by using a new method useForm().
